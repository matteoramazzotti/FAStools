# FAStools

FAStools is a compendium of perl scripts that I've written durign the years to manage and analyze FASTA-formatted biological sequences.
It is intended to be used in the linux/macOSX shell. Although some script may operate well in Windows, they are neither written not maintained for MS.

Each script has its own mini-help available by an no-option run.
