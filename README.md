# FAStools

FAStools is a compendium of perl scripts that I've written durign the years to manage and analyze FASTA-formatted biological sequences.
It is intended to be used in the linux/macOSX shell. Although some script may operate well in Windows, they are neither written not maintained for MS.

FAStools does not use perl modules but sometimes makes extensive use of basic linux shell commands.

Each script has its own mini-help available by an no-option run.
